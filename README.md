# lsg: Large sparse graph library

The Large Sparse Graph library is a C++ library for working with large sparse graphs (on disk, without loading them in memory). In particular, it includes methods used for computing related nodes in a graph, as discussed in a [AAAI 2007 paper](https://pierre.senellart.com/publications/ollivier2007finding/).
