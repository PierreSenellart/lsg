This is the large sparse graph library, a C++ library for dealing with
large (several million nodes) sparse graphs.

PREREQUISITES
-------------
GNU make, a reasonably recent C++ compiler. The library has only been
tested on i386-linux, x86_64-linux, and sun4u-sunos9 architectures, but
should work with other architectures, possibly with minor changes.

COMPILATION
-----------
"make" should be enough to compile the graph library lsg/lsg.a, as well
as the executables.

TESTS
-----
./RunTests run all test units. Every test should pass. Note that the
compilation of RunTests uses libtut, the Test Unit Framework (provided).

EXECUTABLES
-----------
BuildGraphFromEdgeList

  Build a PackedGraph from a file containing edges of the graph and a
file with node labels (one per line). The edge file must be in either of
the following format:

3
no values
0 1 2
1 2
2 0
  
or:
3
with values
0 1,1 2,3
1 2,3
2 0,1

(the second format allows weighted edges)

ComputeInvariantMeasure
  Compute the equilibrium measure of a strongly connected stochastic
graph.

DumpSampleFiles
  Test program for dumping XML graphs of the different steps of each
"Related Nodes" method.

ExtractFirstSCC
  Extract the main strongly component of a graph.

Idftrans
  Modify a graph by amplifying transition probabilities by log(1/nu_i),
where nu is the equilibrium measure.
  
Normalize
  Stochastify a graph.

PageRank
  Compute PageRank over a graph.

RelatedPages
  Computed "Related Nodes" over a graph, through various different
methods.

Reverse
  Compute the reversed Markov chain (with respect to a measure).

Statistics
  Give some basic statistics about a graph.

Symmetrize
  Compute the symmetrized Markov chain (with respect to a measure).

TextVector2BinaryVector
  Convert between the two different representations of a (Row)Vector.
